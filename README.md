# "Ocean" theme for i3-gaps

These are most of my configs and other files I once used for my laptop's rice. I don't use it anymore but I'm keeping it for others to enjoy.

Here's what it looks like:

There are more images in [this album](http://imgur.com/a/WkvTg). The **wallpaper** is included.

For these settings to work you need:

- i3-gaps
- compton
- Xfce (optionally)

**When using Xfce**, use its session manager to set xfdesktop and xfwm4 to never restart, have i3 and compton start on boot, and save the session.

**When not using Xfce**, configure i3bar or some other bar of your choosing. Or do whatever. Your choice.

The **terminal color scheme** is called **Smyck**. You can find it on [its homepage](http://color.smyck.org/) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/hukl/Smyck-Color-Scheme/).
